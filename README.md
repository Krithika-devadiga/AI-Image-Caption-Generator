# 🧠 AI Image Captioning Web App

This project is a Flask-based web application that uses a Transformer-based deep learning model to generate **automatic captions for images**. Upload any image, and get a meaningful caption generated by 

## ✨ Features

- 📷 Upload image through a simple UI
- 🧠 Generates intelligent image captions using Transformers
- 🔊 Uses pre-trained models from Hugging Face (`blip-image-captioning-base`)
- 🌐 Web interface built with HTML, CSS, and Flask
- 📦 Lightweight and easy to deploy

## 📁 Project Structure

- `flask-captioner/`: Contains the Flask backend files including the deep learning model, captioning logic, and the main app file (app.py).

- `index.html`: The main HTML frontend for uploading images and displaying AI-generated captions.

- `style.css`: CSS file used for UI design and animated background effects to enhance user experience.

- `script.js`: (Optional) JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the frontend.

- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and folders (like __pycache__ or large model files) to be excluded from version control.

- `README.md`: This documentation file that describes the project’s purpose, setup steps, and usage instructions.

## 🖼️ How It Works

1. User uploads an image through the form.
2. Flask handles the image backend and loads the model.
3. Model processes the image and generates a caption.
4. Caption is displayed on the web page below the image.
